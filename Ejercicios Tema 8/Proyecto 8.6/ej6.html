          When I found out I was going to be learning how to work with CSS, I
          was about to break down into tears - happy tears, of course! I could
          not believe one of my lifelong dreams was about to come true: I would
          be learning the most beautiful style sheet language in the whole
          world. It was not always easy, though - there were some bumps on the
          road. But with my steely determination and the help from my extremely
          talented, knowledgeable and humble teacher, I was able to overcome
          every difficulty that came upon me. Maybe learning CSS is the best
          thing that has ever happened to me; it has spurred my creativity in
          ways I no longer thought possible. I will always love and cherish CSS
          and here are some of my delicately crafted webpages to attest to it.

        <h3>(Not so) Plain CSS</h3>
        <p>
          I am not afraid to admit my first jobs are not exactly stellar. At
          least I can see a steady progress, and after all, learning a new
          language was never going to be easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could see CSS was going to be as challenging as fascinating, and
          that made me all the more excited. We can all see these were no
          masterpieces, but *Vanilla CSS* is full of charm anyway, don't you
          think?

        <h3>Float? Why not?</h3>
        <p>
          We all love floating. It's so much fun and sometimes unpredictable,
          which makes it even more exciting. When I was learning how to use
          *floats*, I would often find myself daydreaming and thinking about
          *the perfect CSS file*.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would I ever be able to create the ultimate CSS file? Would I ever get
          millions of people to praise my code's pristine beauty? Only time will
          tell...

        <h3>Position me, baby!</h3>
        <p>
          Location, location, location. That’s all that mattered to me at some
          point. I was getting frustrated! For some reason some CSS elements
          refused to position themselves where I wanted them to be. Luckily, my
          new best friend *position* came to the rescue.
        </p>
        <p>
          All my prayers had been answered, at last. I positioned elements
          everywhere at the drop of a hat, and all of them simply complied. I
          was feeling more powerful than ever before, but the road to
          enlightenment was still full of twists and turns.

        <h3>Mind-bending FlexBox</h3>
        <p>
          Oh, *FlexBox*. You will always be special to me. You showed me there
          are other ways to design complex webpage layouts, and I will never
          forget about that. It is as if you unlocked a door for me, a door
          which lead the way to a magic fantasy land where my creativity could
          finally run unbridled and free.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was no longer tied to restrictions - if I could imagine it, I could
          code it. And that was all thanks to you, *FlexBox*. I am sure we will
          be friends forever.

        <h3>A serious affair: CSS Grid</h3>
        <p>
          Just when I thought I knew how to use CSS, along came *CSS Grid*. I am
          not gonna lie, I was scared at first. *Grid* is the gateway to a
          complex, bidimensional world. But at the same time it is so tempting,
          intriguing and sexy.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/grid.jpg" />
        <p>
          With *FlexBox* and *Grid* I felt truly unstoppable, and once I got the
          hang of it, I finally unlocked all my full potencial as a frontend
          developer. The world is my oyster now, and I'm certainly here for it.
          *CSS Grid* made it happen, and it helped me become the best coder I
          can possibly be.

        <h3>When in doubt, be responsive</h3>
        <p>
          The icing on the cake was *Responsive Web Design*. I felt like the
          most powerful wizard, shaping the most intricate layouts and creating
          order from chaos. Just with a little tweaking, I manifested my most
          fascinating and out-there ideas onto the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS had no secrets for me anymore. Finally, I became a superlative
          "CSS whisperer". *I am CSS and CSS is me*. You can call me a rockstar
          frontend developer.
