        <h3>Penguin Trivia</h3>
        <div class="species">
          <h2>Species</h2>
          <p>
            There are 18 unique species of penguin in the world, though two
            species, the northern rockhopper and southern rockhopper, are
            sometimes considered the same species. While some penguins are
            widespread and thriving, 13 penguin species have declining
            populations. Five types of penguins are considered endangered and
            facing possible extinction if strong protection and conservation
            measures are not taken. Adopting a symbolic penguin is a great way
            anyone can help these birds.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="location">
          <h2>Location</h2>
          <p>
            Penguins are primarily found only in the Southern Hemisphere. While
            most people associate penguins with Antarctica, these birds are much
            more widespread than just cold regions. Penguin populations can be
            found in South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, as
            well as many small islands in the southern Pacific Ocean. In
            captivity, penguins can be found all over the world.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="equator">
          <h2>Equator</h2>
          <p>
            The naturally northernmost penguin species is the Galapagos penguin,
            which lives year-round near the equator on the Galapagos Islands.
            This penguin regularly crosses the equator into the Northern
            Hemisphere as it swims while feeding.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="wings">
          <h2>Wings</h2>
          <p>
            Penguins lost the ability to fly millions of years ago, but their
            powerful flippers and streamlined bodies make them very accomplished
            swimmers. They are the fastest swimming and deepest diving species
            of any birds and can stay underwater up to 20 minutes at a time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="jumping">
          <h2>Jumping</h2>
          <p>
            While swimming, penguins will leap in shallow arcs above the surface
            of the water, a practice called porpoising. This coats their plumage
            with tiny bubbles that reduce friction, allowing them to swim as
            fast as 22 miles per hour (35 kph). It may also help them evade
            predators and allows them to breathe more regularly, and some
            scientists theorize that penguins may make these leaps out of sheer
            joy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="colors">
          <h2>Colors</h2>
          <p>
            The light front and dark back tuxedo-like coloration of classic
            penguin plumage is called countershading. This stark color pattern
            provides superb camouflage from above and below to protect penguins
            in the water. It also helps disguise penguins from their prey so
            they can hunt more successfully. Male and female penguins look alike
            and have the same coloration.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="diet">
          <h2>Diet</h2>
          <p>
            Penguins are carnivores that catch all their food live in the sea.
            Depending on the species they can eat a variety of different marine
            animals, including fish, squid, shrimp, krill, crabs, and other
            crustaceans. Because their diets are so specialized, penguins are
            called piscivorous.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="eyesight">
          <h2>Eyesight</h2>
          <p>
            Penguins’ eyes work better underwater than they do in the air,
            giving them superior eyesight to spot prey while hunting, even in
            cloudy, dark, or murky water, or where water is turbulent.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="size">
          <h2>Size</h2>
          <p>
            The emperor penguin is the largest penguin species, standing up to
            48 inches tall and weighing up to 90 pounds when mature and not
            fasting to incubate eggs. The little penguin is the smallest penguin
            at just 12 inches tall and weighing only 2 pounds.

            <strong>Kenny McCormick</strong> is a main character in the animated
            television series South Park, along with Stan Marsh, Kyle
            Broflovski, and Eric Cartman. His oft-muffled and indiscernible
            speech—the result of his parka hood covering his mouth—is provided
            by co-creator Matt Stone. He debuted on television when South Park
            first aired on August 13, 1997, after having first appeared in The
            Spirit of Christmas shorts created by Stone and long-time
            collaborator Trey Parker. n a running gag most prevalent during the
            first five seasons of the series, Kenny would suffer an excruciating
            death before returning alive and well in the next episode with
            little or no explanation.

            <strong>John Rambo</strong> is a fictional character in the Rambo
            franchise. He first appeared in the 1972 novel First Blood by David
            Morrell, but later became more famous as the protagonist of the film
            series, in which he was played by Sylvester Stallone. The portrayal
            of the character earned Stallone widespread acclaim and recognition.
            The term "Rambo" is used commonly to describe a lone wolf who is
            reckless, disregards orders, uses violence to solve problems, enters
            dangerous situations alone, and is exceptionally tough, callous, raw
            and aggressive.

            <strong>Yoda</strong> is a supporting character in the Star Wars
            universe, first appearing in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back.
            He is a small, green humanoid alien who is powerful with the Force
            and served as Grandmaster of the Jedi Order. In The Empire Stikes
            Back, Yoda was voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz, who reprised the
            role in Return of the Jedi, the prequel trilogy, and the sequel
            trilogy. Outside of the films, the character has been mainly voiced
            by Tom Kane, starting with the 2003 Clone Wars animated television
            series. Yoda has since become an iconic figue in popular culture due
            to his distinct pattern of speech and role as a wise mentor. In his
            first appearance in the original trilogy, Yoda is described as the
            mentor of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and lives in exile on the swamp planet of
            Dagobah. He trains Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force until his
            death at the age of 900 in Return of the Jedi, though he later
            returns as a Force spirit.

            <strong>Bart Simpson</strong> is a fictional character in the
            American animated television series The Simpsons and part of the
            Simpson family. He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared
            on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April
            19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed Bart while
            waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been
            called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip, Life in
            Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. While
            the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family
            members, Bart's name is an anagram of the word brat. After appearing
            on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family
            received its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989.
            Bart has appeared in every Simpsons episode except "Four Great Women
            and a Manicure".

            <strong>Patrick Star</strong> is a fictional character in the
            American animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. He is
            voiced by actor Bill Fagerbakke and was created and designed by
            marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. He first appeared
            in the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999. In
            addition to his supporting role on SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick
            also serves as the main protagonist of The Patrick Star Show, which
            premiered in 2021. An overweight pink starfish, Patrick lives
            underneath a rock in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, right
            next door to Squidward Tentacles' moai. His most significant
            character traits are his laziness and low intelligence, although he
            occasionally shows that he is smarter than he seems.His ignorance
            often gets him and his best friend, SpongeBob SquarePants, into
            trouble. Patrick is unemployed and a self-proclaimed expert in the
            "art of doing nothing".

            <strong>Mario</strong> is a character in the Mario video game
            franchise, owned by Nintendo and created by Japanese video game
            designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Acting as the company's mascot, as well
            as being the eponymous protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared
            in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short,
            pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his
            adventures generally center upon rescuing Princess Peach from the
            Koopa villain Bowser. Mario's fraternal twin brother and sidekick is
            Luigi. Over time, Mario's appearance has become more defined; blue
            eyes, white gloves, brown shoes, a red "M" in a white circle on the
            front of his hat and gold buttons on his overalls have been added.
            The colors of his shirt and overalls were also reversed from a blue
            shirt with red overalls to a red shirt with blue overalls.

            Hemisphere. The Galápagos Islands and their surrounding waters form
            the Galápagos Province of Ecuador, the Galápagos National Park, and
            the Galápagos Marine Reserve. The principal language on the islands

            The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), also known as the Cape
            penguin or South African penguin, is a species of penguin confined
            to southern African waters. Like all extant penguins, it is
            flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and
            flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Adults weigh an
            average of 2.2–3.5 kg (4.9–7.7 lb) and are 60–70 cm (24–28 in) tall.
            The species has distinctive pink patches of skin above the eyes and
            a black facial mask. The body upperparts are black and sharply
            delineated from the white underparts, which are spotted and marked
            with a black band. The pink glands above their eyes help them with
            thermoregulation. Once extremely numerous, the African penguin is
            declining rapidly due to a combination of several threats and is
            classified as endangered. It is a charismatic species and is popular
            with tourists. They can be found in South Africa among other
            countries.

          <p>
            Patagonia is home to five penguin species - Magellanic, Humboldt,
            Gentoo, Southern Rockhopper and King. Depending on the species and
            the season, the inquisitive creatures can be seen anywhere from
            Punta Arenas to Tierra del Fuego on day trips to rocky hillside
            nests or boat landings at giant colonies. Closely related to the
            African Penguin, Magellanic Penguins are the only migratory,
            offshore foraging species. They are migratory birds, moving north in
            the winter months, often as far as Peru or Brazil. Magellanic
            penguins generally breed in burrows or under bushes, in a variety of
            habitats from low forests to grassland to bare rocks, often on
            islands or headlands. Some colonies on the Argentinean side number
            several hundreds of thousands of pairs. Their diet is fish based:
            mainly anchovies and sardines, supplemented by cephalopods.

          <h4>Namibia</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The Penguin Islands are a historical group of mostly scattered
            islands and rocks situated along a stretch of 355 kilometres (221
            mi) along the coastline of Namibia. Not forming a geographic whole,
            the Namibian government formally lists them as the Off-Shore
            islands. Their name comes from the presence of African penguins
            which inhabit the coastal region surrounding Namibia and South
            Africa. The islands are scattered over a long coastal region.
            Although a few of them form small clusters or groups, such as the
            islands in Lüderitz Bay, the Penguin Islands lack the mutual
            proximity of a natural archipelago or island chain.

            Thirteen of the world’s 18 penguin species have been recorded in the
            New Zealand region (including the Ross Dependency). Nine of these
            species breed there. Small population sizes, restricted geographical
            ranges, predators and habitat degradation all contribute to the
            vulnerability of mainland New Zealand penguin species. The
            yellow-eyed penguin is the New Zealand species most affected by
            habitat loss. A forest or shrubland nesting species, the yellow-eyed
            has come under pressure as forest has been replaced with pasture. A
            slight warming of sea temperatures in the past 50 years is thought
            to have forced vital food species such as krill further south, with
            a subsequent impact on several penguin species.
